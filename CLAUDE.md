# SwarmLLM — Claude Code Instructions

> **Quick start**: Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the canonical architecture (subsystems, channels, SharedState sub-struct layout, protocols, security model) before exploring code. Per-developer dependency notes may live in `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-SwarmLLM/memory/` outside the repo.

## Project Overview

SwarmLLM is a single Rust binary that functions as a peer-to-peer node in a decentralized LLM inference network. Each node simultaneously participates in a P2P network, runs an HTTP server (OpenAI-compatible API + admin dashboard), and manages local resources (GPU/CPU compute, storage, bandwidth).

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio (multi-threaded)
- **Minimum Rust Version**: 1.90+ (set by `redb`; enforced by `msrv_claim_matches_the_dependency_tree` in `tests/repo_consistency.rs` — do not edit by hand, run that test)
- **Primary Port**: 8800 (HTTP API on TCP:8800, P2P on TCP:8810 + UDP/QUIC:8800)

## Architecture

The daemon spawns 12 subsystems as Tokio tasks wired together with `mpsc` channels:

- **NetworkManager** — libp2p swarm: Kademlia DHT + GossipSub + request_response
- **InferenceRouter** — request queuing, pipeline assembly, execution coordination
- **MessageDispatcher** — routes inbound network messages to appropriate subsystems
- **CreditLedger** — local credit balance tracking, transaction signing, gossip
- **HealthMonitor** — periodic health pings, rebalancing triggers
- **ShardRebalancer** — shard redistribution on node join/leave events
- **AcquisitionManager** — BLAKE3-verified model download from network peers
- **ApiServer** — Axum HTTP: OpenAI + Anthropic APIs + MCP server + admin dashboard + WebSocket
- **PoolManager** — device pool management, credit forwarding, invitation protocol
- **AutoShardManager** — VRAM-aware automatic shard acquisition + smart pruning of over-replicated shards
- **HfWatcher** — R112: hourly HuggingFace trending-GGUF poll, seeds wishlist + auto-promotes models above download/age thresholds to `DemandVerified`
- **UpdateChecker** — periodic GitHub release polling, SHA256-verified binary download, atomic apply

Shared state lives in `Arc<SharedState>` with `DashMap` for concurrent access. SharedState is organized into 4 logical sub-structs:
- `state.events` (`EventBus`) — `activity_tx`, `activity_history`, `dashboard_tx`, `update_state`, `ws_tickets`
- `state.credits` (`CreditPool`) — `credit_balance`, `pool_state`, `pool_registry`, `pool_tx`, `trust_manager`, `escrow_manager`, `anti_gaming`, `private_mode`, `offline_mode`, etc.
- `state.models` (`ModelMgmt`) — `acquisition_progress`, `hf_sources`, `auto_manage_*`, `model_trust`, `locked_shards`, `removed_by_user` (user-deleted shard tombstones, 08-21), `prune_history`, `wishlist` (R111), `hf_trending_cache` (R112), `shard_download_backoff` (per-shard exponential download cooldown so one stuck download can't monopolize a slot), `shards_needing_repair` (shards found CORRUPT and awaiting a fresh verified copy — written only via `mark_shard_for_repair`), `shards_pending_verification` (held shards whose EXPECTED hash changed, so their bytes must be re-checked — how a node learns from the swarm that what it serves is wrong), etc.
- `state.metrics` (`MetricsProviders`) — `node_stats`, `inference_requests_total`, `channel_metrics`, `providers_config`, `swarm_capacity` (R110), `hedge_tracker` (R136 Layer 2), `prefetch_orchestrator` (R136 Layer 3), `peer_speed` + `peer_model_warm_at` (measured per-peer prefill/decode speed — sizes segment timeouts and ranks candidates), etc.

Cross-cutting fields (identity, db, peer_registry, model_registry, executor, split_models, etc.) remain on the root struct, along with the two configs: `config` (the boot-time snapshot, for startup-only decisions) and `live_config` (the current one — **read it via `state.cfg()`** for anything the user can change while the node runs).

## Build Phases

All 20 phases complete. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full phase history. Deferred items documented there.

## Key Dependencies

libp2p 0.56, axum 0.8, candle-core/candle-transformers 0.10 (CUDA), redb 4, ed25519-dalek 2, x25519-dalek 2, chacha20poly1305, blake3, dashmap 6, clap 4, tracing, reqwest, zstd. See `Cargo.toml` for full list.

## Coding Conventions

### Error Handling
- Use `thiserror` for defining error types in `src/error.rs` (SwarmError enum)
- Use `anyhow` only in `main.rs` and integration tests
- Map SwarmError variants to HTTP status codes via `ApiError` wrapper
- Variant → status contract (see `.claude/rules/completeness.md`):
  - `Validation` → 400 (API input)
  - `ModelNotAvailable` / `ShardNotFound` / `NotFound` → 404
  - `Config` → startup ONLY
  - `Internal` → actual bugs (500)
  - `ProviderError { status, body }` → upstream cloud errors (preserves status)
  - `ServiceUnavailable` → THIS server can't serve (503), NOT upstream
- Network errors: retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Inference errors: return immediately, never retry silently
- Shard integrity errors: quarantine shard, re-download, penalize peer trust
- Credit errors: degrade priority tier, never block

### Naming
- Types: `PascalCase` (e.g., `NodeId`, `ModelManifest`, `PipelineSegment`)
- Functions/methods: `snake_case`
- Newtype wrappers for type safety: `NodeId([u8; 32])`, `ModelId(String)`, `ShardId { model_id, index }`
- Short display for NodeId: first 8 bytes hex-encoded

### Serialization
- HTTP API: `serde_json` (match OpenAI format exactly)
- Network protocol: Unified codec — `serde_json` for control messages, binary with type-tag byte for tensor payloads
- Config: TOML via `toml` crate
- Database values: `serde_json` serialized into redb

### Async Patterns
- All subsystems communicate via `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels
- SharedState fields use `DashMap` for concurrent reads or `RwLock` for single-value state
- Graceful shutdown via `tokio::sync::watch` channel
- Use `tokio::select!` in daemon/mod.rs to wait for shutdown or task exit

### Logging
- Use `tracing` with structured spans (include context like peer_count, request_id, model_id)
- Target format: `swarmllm::module::submodule`
- Verbosity levels: info (default), debug (-v), debug+libp2p (-vv), trace (-vvv)
- Key metrics: peers.connected, inference.requests, inference.latency_ms, credits.balance, shards.hosted

### Frontend
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, no Node.js build step
- Embedded into binary via `include_dir!` macro at compile time
- Component architecture: `App` global namespace, 28 JS files (4 core + 19 components + init.js + 4 standalone utilities)
  - `js/core/` — state.js (namespace + shared state + storage keys), utils.js (format helpers, DOM builders, extractErrorMessage, getApiErrorMessage, apiAction, `renderMarkdown`/`inlineMarkdown` — the ONE markdown renderer, shared by chat and any future surface — and `initTopBannerOffset`, which keeps `--top-banner-height` in step with the DOM so a fixed top banner never covers the header), data.js (data store + authFetch + dedup), tooltip.js (unified popover replacing native `title=`)
  - `js/components/` — ui.js, chat.js, claude-code.js, dashboard.js, dashboard-shards.js (pure shard HTML builders exposed as `App.dashboardShards`), models.js, auto-manage-status.js, settings.js, setup.js, welcome.js (R127 — first-run tour modal), downloads.js, notifications.js, identity.js, network-map.js, compare.js, responses.js, pool.js, swarm-tab.js (R111 — wishlist + capacity-plan + performance view), reference-models.js (R148 — shared test-model picker, `App.referenceModels`)
  - `js/init.js` — event binding, initialization, public API export
  - `js/i18n.js`, `js/providers.js`, `js/neural-bg.js`, `js/topojson-client.min.js` — standalone utilities (loaded before App)
- 3 modal overlays (setup, settings, R127 `#welcome-modal` first-run tour) + 11 `<template>` elements for repeating UI structures (session items, chat messages, toasts, model cards, etc.)
- All storage keys registered as named constants on `App` (e.g., `App.SESSIONS_KEY`, `App.MODEL_SORT_KEY`)
- Dark/light/system theme toggle, CSS custom properties for theming
- i18n: 1335 translation keys (1337 entries per locale incl. `_lang` + `_dir`) across 21 languages via `frontend/i18n/{lang}.json`, `I18n.t()` + `data-i18n` attributes. All files sorted by key; parity + these counts are asserted by `tests/repo_consistency.rs` (update the count in BOTH CLAUDE.md and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when adding keys). Every locale carries idiomatic native strings, not English fallback — a new key MUST be translated across all 21 locales (see `.claude/rules/i18n.md`). Per-batch history in `memory/`.
- Frontend payload: **~1065 KB** (html 130 + css 247 + js 687), plus **one** locale at a time (~83 KB en; Thai is the largest at 150 KB) and **88 KB of bundled fonts** (`frontend/fonts/`, IBM Plex Latin subsets — NOT counted by the payload test, which sums `js|css|html` only) — the other 20 locales are never fetched. Measured byte-accurate and capped by `frontend_payload_stays_within_budget` in `tests/repo_consistency.rs`; the long-standing "< 200KB target" in this file was 5.6x out and nothing checked it. The cap is a regression budget, not a goal: it fails on a step change, not on ordinary growth.
- Communication: WebSocket for real-time, REST for initial load, SSE for chat streaming
- WebSocket message types (only 5): `activity_event` (unified event bus — all subsystem events, toasts, prune history), `stats_update` (2s interval — stats, shard registry, acquisitions, **swarm_capacity** (R110), **wishlist** (R111), **hardware** (2026-09-06 — RAM/GPU/disk; read from a CACHE refreshed on a blocking thread at most every 6 s, because measuring it spawns `nvidia-smi` at ~90 ms and this payload is shared by every client)), `peer_list` (full peer snapshot on change), `models_changed` (shard download/load/prune signals dashboard refresh), `update_available` (new version detected)
- Broadcast channels (only 2): `activity_tx` (ActivityEvent — 256 capacity) for all events + `dashboard_tx` (DashboardSignal enum — 32 capacity) for PeersChanged/ModelsChanged/UpdateAvailable signals
- Frontend single entry point: all events flow through `_handleActivityEvent()` in notifications.js — handles routing (activity vs network panel), toast display (via `toast_level` field), prune history, per-model ticker, pool refresh
- Activity events are i18n-ready: frontend formats via `I18n.t('activity.<kind>', params)` with fallback to backend English message

## Testing

- **Counts** (re-measured 2026-09-07): **2423 lib** + 12 ignored with `--features dev,claude-subscription` — the claude-subscription provider carries its own tests, so **always say which feature set a count came from**. 79 integration (31 api_test + 34 phase10_11 + 14 yamux_substream) + 1 ignored e2e, 70 repo-consistency, 1 `api_key_side_effects`, 35 `swarmllm-types` (**not** covered by a bare `cargo test`; CI runs it explicitly), 11 in the vendored request-response patch (`--manifest-path vendor/libp2p-request-response/Cargo.toml --lib`). Clippy clean.
- **Benches and harnesses — see `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` § Benchmarks for the full list and the traps.** The ones reached for most: `examples/prefill_bench.rs` (drives `SplitModel::forward` directly, no daemon — `SWARM_BENCH_MODEL`, `SWARM_BENCH_PROMPT`, `SWARM_BENCH_DECODE`, `SWARM_BENCH_REPS`, `SWARM_BENCH_DEVICE=cuda`, and `SWARM_BENCH_SPEC_WIDTHS=1,2,4,8` which prices a K-token forward against a 1-token one at the same history depth — the number that decides whether speculation pays; pair with `SWARMLLM_PROFILE=1` for the per-stage breakdown), `examples/qmatmul_bench.rs` (asserts the tiled kernel is bit-identical to upstream), `examples/smoke_test.sh [binary] [port]` (9 checks on an isolated node — run it on the DOWNLOADED release artifact; it now reports checks that COULD NOT RUN separately and never says "all checks passed" over them, and fails fast if the node it started dies — before 2026-08-25 it skipped the three inference checks silently and still claimed success, so "smoke 8/8" had been passing here without ever exercising inference), `examples/constrained_node_test.sh` (a SMALL node reproduced locally — every memory defect since #452 came from one, and none reproduced on a dev box; isolated node + a small `max_ram_mb`, checks the itemised over-budget refusal, then `SIGKILL`s the worker and requires the NEXT request to be served), `examples/soak_test.sh` (`HOURS=` must be a WHOLE number; data dir is per-`PORT`, so two soaks no longer kill each other), `examples/tokenizer_scaling.rs` (`SWARM_TOK_HEADER` at a model's `gguf_header.bin` — times `encode` against prompt length and prints `tokenizer_model`/`merges`/`scores`, which is what decides WHICH encode path a GGUF takes; a doubling that quadruples the time is the signature. `SWARM_TOK_TEXT` prints the ids for one string, which is how our output gets compared against HuggingFace `tokenizers`. Found #420 and #421).
- **Measurement discipline** (paid for repeatedly): min-of-N on an IDLE box — the same unchanged code measured 0.42 ms and 0.97 ms across runs here, and a benchmark taken while a build runs is worthless. **min-of-N is for benchmarks, not for live measurement** (#367). A/B inside ONE binary via an env switch (`SWARMLLM_DECODE_CALIBRATE=0`, `SWARMLLM_DECODE_ATTN=standard`, `SWARMLLM_FORCE_STANDARD_ATTN`, `SWARMLLM_FLASH_OFFSET_CAUSAL=0`, `SWARMLLM_GQA_DECODE_FLASH=1`, `SWARMLLM_GROUPED_GQA_DECODE_ONLY=1`), never across two builds. **Verify the mechanism fired**, not just that the outcome improved. Pinned reference models: `docs/REFERENCE_MODELS.md`.
- Unit tests: in-module `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` — multi-node simulations with `--test-threads=1`
- Real-model spawn-and-infer test: set `SWARMLLM_TEST_MODEL_DIR` to a fully-populated model directory (e.g. `~/.local/share/swarmllm/models/tinyllama-1.1b-...`) and run `cargo test --test integration_phase10_11 -- --ignored end_to_end`. No synthetic GGUF fixture is committed; see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Deferred Items.
- CI pipeline: `cargo fmt` → `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` → `cargo test` → `cargo build --release`

## Key Design Decisions

- Config priority: CLI flags > env vars (SWARMLLM_ prefix) > config.toml > defaults. Provider API keys also loaded from `.env` file in data dir (standard names: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.)
- Data dir: `~/.local/share/swarmllm/` (Linux), `~/Library/Application Support/swarmllm/` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\swarmllm\` (Windows)
- Port layout: HTTP API on TCP:port, P2P TCP on port+10 (Noise+Yamux), P2P QUIC on UDP:port
- Credit transactions require dual Ed25519 signatures (serving node + requesting node)
- **Credits are DORMANT (2026-08-17) — they gate nothing.** `MIN_BALANCE_FOR_INFERENCE = 0` and `calculate_tier` returns a constant, so no balance affects who is served, how fast, or what the dashboard shows. The accounting still runs. Reason: credit has never moved between nodes as payment for work — each node mints its own figure (the one real transfer, pool credit *forwarding*, just concentrates self-minted numbers). Design + exit criteria in `docs/CREDITS_DESIGN.md`; `credits_stay_dormant` in `tests/repo_consistency.rs` fails the build if a balance starts gating again.
- KV-cache sessions expire after 10 minutes of inactivity (configurable)
- Shard verification: BLAKE3 content hash checked on every load
- Pipeline failover: hot-standby nodes pre-identified per segment
- **Encryption — two layers, distinct concerns:**
  - **Layer 1 — `network.enable_encryption` (DEFAULT TRUE).** ChaCha20-Poly1305 sealing of activations between hops via per-session X25519 ECDH. Every inter-node tensor forward is encrypted on the wire. AAD covers cleartext header + spec/kv-truncate/chunk-meta trailers (`build_layer_forward_aad` is the single source of truth). On the receiver side, decryption is offloaded from the NetworkManager event loop via `tokio::spawn` (R139 Phase C). Failure is hard: there is NO plaintext fallback on `seal()` failure — the forward is dropped with `LayerResult::error`. Disabling this flag is only sensible for local-loopback debugging.
  - **Layer 2 — `inference.encrypted_pipeline` ("boomerang", DEFAULT FALSE, per-model override).** Forces the local node to handle BOTH the first segment (embedding) AND the last segment (sampling). No remote node ever sees the plaintext prompt OR the sampled tokens. **It does see the intermediate hidden states in PLAINTEXT** — activations are sealed hop-to-hop by Layer 1, and `network/manager/tensors.rs` calls `session_manager.open(...)` and hands the plaintext to the worker, because a matmul cannot run on ciphertext. This is a STRUCTURAL guarantee (the ends stay here), not a cryptographic one against the computing node, and hidden states are partially invertible back to input text — published recovery is ~81% at the final layer, which is also why a "keep more layers local" dial is not the answer (`docs/FUTURE_WORK.md`). Real encrypted compute means FHE/MPC: BERT-Base at 128 tokens on 4x A100 is ~193 s and ~1.3 GB of inter-device traffic, so it is three orders of magnitude away from usable here. Requires the local node to hold shard 0 + final shard. Adds ~1 RTT/token. This is the strongest privacy mode; Layer 1 alone leaves entry/exit nodes able to read the cleartext at their boundary.
- **Private mode**: restricts YOUR outbound inference to pool/LAN nodes only. Nodes still serve the swarm. Single `allowed_node_set()` in `src/pool/scope.rs` gates everything. Runtime-toggleable via `AtomicBool`. Shard pinning lets pool owners assign models to devices.
- **No full model download required**: A node NEVER needs the full GGUF or all shards to participate in inference. Shards are downloaded individually via byte-range requests. Downloading all shards (or a full model) is opt-in only — for users who want offline inference or to seed more shards to the network. Never add code that implicitly downloads a full model or reconstructs a GGUF from shards. All inference loads from shard files + gguf_header.bin.

## Subagent Choices for This Codebase

When spawning subagents in this repo, use these model picks (overrides defaults that would otherwise pick haiku):
- `Task(feature-dev:code-reviewer)` → sonnet (this codebase's invariants need real reasoning, not pattern-matching)
- `Task(feature-dev:code-architect)` → sonnet
- `Task(Plan)` → sonnet
- Never delegate production code writing — opus (this main session) writes it
- `Task(root-cause)` → sonnet. Reach for it BEFORE attributing a failure or reverting. Its verdict is evidence, not opinion: it must have observed the symptom absent when the suspect is absent.

## Reference Documents

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — **Primary reference** — current architecture, subsystems, protocols, security model
- `docs/book/` — mdBook documentation site (getting started, API reference, architecture, troubleshooting)
- `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` — DIAG: log instrumentation guide for debugging
- `docs/CREDITS_DESIGN.md` — **read before touching credits.** Why the economy is
  switched off, what is actually true today, the bilateral-settlement design, and
  the exit criteria that must hold before any of it is switched back on
- `docs/FUTURE_WORK.md` — deferred items with enough context to pick up cold
- `.claude/rules/architecture.md` — invariants (SharedState, broadcast channels, scheduler oracle, centralised wire-format helpers)
- `.claude/rules/diagnosis.md` — **read before blaming any change for any symptom, and before implementing anything non-trivial.** Rule 0: look up how the failure mode is solved elsewhere first — WireGuard's per-keypair replay counter and vLLM's Head-Room Admission each changed an implementation the same day. Then: baseline before blaming, verify the mechanism fired, check the test fails without the fix.
- `.claude/agents/root-cause.md` — `Task(root-cause)` establishes CAUSED / NOT-CAUSED / UNDETERMINED for a suspected cause, and never proposes a fix. Use it before reverting or attributing, especially when the suspect is your own recent change.
- `.claude/sweep-log.jsonl` — per-finding history of every `/sweep` round (status: fixed / wontfix / deferred). Grep before re-reporting potential issues.

## Status

All 20 build phases complete. All subsystems wired — no stubs. **2423 lib (dev,claude-subscription) — re-measured 2026-09-07, full suite green (exit 0)** + 79 integration (31 `integration` + 34 `integration_phase10_11` + 14 `yamux_substream`) + 70 repo-consistency + 1 api_key_side_effects + 35 swarmllm-types tests passing; 12 lib + 1 e2e ignored (env-var or manual). Clippy clean on default, `--no-default-features --features dev,claude-subscription` (that combination is the documented one — plain `--features dev` leaves `embedded` on too and fails on dead code), a `--features llama` check, and `flash-attn --lib`. `cargo audit` reports only advisories already documented and accepted in `SECURITY.md` — at the .159 release, two (`hickory-proto` RUSTSEC-2026-0118/0119, both transitive via libp2p) plus the `paste` unmaintained warning.

**Released and deployed: v0.3.160-alpha (2026-09-06, tag on `a52f5e8d`).** Local
`225e6fe7` (CUDA artifact, downloaded sha256 == published, `ggml_cuda_init` = 1,
0 ERROR, inference verified, node id kept; rollback
`~/.local/bin/swarmllm.0.3.159-alpha.bak`) and Proxmox `9684263580c6660f`
(.deb `0.3.160-alpha-1` over `0.3.159-alpha-1`, hash verified after transfer,
`active` + `enabled`, no `.dpkg-old`, journal errors "-- No entries --", back in
each other's peer lists) both on it. Gate: CI green on the tagged commit, Cache
warm green on the dependency-changing commit (later commits touch no deps and
no `cfg`-gated code), Release + Docker green (10/10 jobs), 25 assets, not draft,
`latest`, sha256 CUDA + deb, **smoke 9/9 + shapes 5 OK / 2 COULD NOT RUN on the
DOWNLOADED artifact, matching the .159 baseline exactly.**
⚠ **`release_shapes.sh` on port 8810 reports "node did not start" — that is the
LIVE node's P2P port** (`8800 + 10`), not a release fault. Use 8819.

**TEN fixes plus one correction. Eight from questions parked waiting on a
reporter's machine that was assumed never to answer, resolved by research and
by local reproduction instead; four from new reports.** The ones worth carrying:

- **A decision made on a COST must be re-derived when the cost changes**, and
  nothing in the code will tell you — it still compiles and still looks
  deliberate. THREE of the ten were this: #479 (a routing veto written when the
  cost model priced local layers with a constant), #482 (a memory floor written
  for a startup ceiling, kept when the figure became a per-admission live
  check), #487 (the hardware panel kept off the live tick at 182 ms, still off
  it after that became 0.43 ms). **After optimising something by an order of
  magnitude, grep for what was arranged around its old price.**
- **#484 was a false privacy assurance**, not a mislabel: the chat banner said
  "your prompts and outputs never leave this device" from shard INVENTORY, while
  `local_fast_path_for` deliberately sends the work to a peer. A word naming a
  fact about FILES must not make a claim about EXECUTION.
- **#481 is a regression we shipped in .154**: giving the local node a memory
  bound made it a "capped candidate", and a DP rule says a capped candidate
  appears at most once — but privacy REQUIRES it at both ends. Privacy routing
  across peers silently stopped, at 11.8x the cost of the route it declined,
  with nothing logged because all-local is a valid private route.
- **#483: a file-scoped guard is a guard against one file.** Widening the
  existing "don't read capacity from the graphics card alone" scan to all of
  `src/` found three more sites the report never mentioned.
- ⚠ **I put ~100 ms of blocking work on the 2 s tick and said it cost under a
  millisecond**, having read a comment about one PART of `detect_hardware` (the
  sysinfo refresh) as describing the whole function, which also spawns
  `nvidia-smi` (90 ms measured). Caught by a subagent that MEASURED. Corrected
  in its own commit because the wrong claim had already gone to the public feed.

**Next up (after the v0.3.160 release; user: batch fixes, releases are slow —
Windows CUDA)**:

(0) **Field-verify.** The .156→.160 fixes are largely unseen on other people's
machines. ⚠ **The Mac mini reporter was assumed never to reply and the three
questions parked on them were resolved WITHOUT them** — by research (the macOS
`available_memory` semantics behind #482) and by local reproduction (#452's
`max_hostable_layers=Some(N)` line, found 2,653 times in this node's own log).
A Discord reply is drafted at `scratchpad/discord_macmini_reply.md` (UNSENT).
Genuinely still unverified in the field: #484's banner on a node that actually
delegates, #483 on a real CPU-only machine, and #481's privacy routing now that
the DP can build it again.

(1) **#447 (iii)** — make the priced search the ONE decision-maker when the
local node is on its processor (`delegation_target` becomes a filter; the DP
compares every shape). Halves (i)+(ii) shipped in .153; #478 (price the shape
you assign) and #479 (the unpriced veto) landed in .160. **Do not attempt the
rest without a way to measure it**: `cbbed678` priced local layers at a penalty
and sent requests to another continent. ⚠ **Any A/B of this gate must first
assert it FIRED** (`Not handing this model to peer` / `segments=3`): peer
latency on this swarm swings 407→7397 ms within minutes against a 1000 ms
bound, so an arm where the gate never ran is not an arm. The #444 comparison is
STILL unmeasured live; the gemma topology it needed has drifted (WSL holds
shards 0-1, Proxmox 2-3, neither whole) and ⚠ **a locally-built binary cannot
run on the Proxmox LXC** (older glibc — `GLIBC_2.39 not found`).

(2) **#446 forward path** — an activation is one indivisible message, so it
needs TCP-ranking or chunked-over-RR. The SHARD half was mitigated in .159
(32 → 8 MiB, a ~4x reduction in draws, NOT a bound). **Still open there: a peer
retry restarts at `chunk_offset: 0` instead of resuming**; the machinery exists
but sits in the code that caused #424's truncation race. The contributor's AWS
g5.xlarge is the right place for the forward half.

(3) prefix-keyed remote KV across turns; (4) f16 stored KV on small cards;
(5) accept/reject at the tail — also the precondition for issue #21's economics;
then the #438 structural rung, peer↔peer RTT gossip, ring decode, prefill
microbatching. Ordered list in `memory/MEMORY.md` § NEXT UP; entries in
`docs/FUTURE_WORK.md`. **Parked**: the OpenClaw ClawHub / npm publish, which
needs the user's credentials.

### Earlier rounds — one line each. Detail in `memory/round_log_*.md`,
gotcha numbers index `memory/gotchas.md`. **Read the named round log before
re-deriving any of these.**

- **.159** (09-06): 16 fixes — the small-machine harness (`examples/constrained_node_test.sh`), #472 a content hash recomputed mid-corrections, the dashboard memory figure that never counted workers. `round_log_0906_dashboard_chat.md`.
- **.158** (09-05): 3 from ONE Qwen3 report — a backend asking for the whole TRAINING window as its context; a prompt left on a CLOSED turn; a `<think>` scratchpad returned as the answer. ⚠ The reporter's headline diagnosis was WRONG (grep against a source-less tarball).
- **.156/.157** (09-05): 23 defects. **#467 — #461 covered 3 of NINE worker-removal sites, missing the CUDA-OOM path both reports came from.** ⚠ Grep the OPERATION; a report's call-site list is symptoms, not scope. `round_log_0905_dead_worker_memory.md`.
- **.153/.154/.155** (09-04): #449 ALL inference broken on every Mac (a socket path over `sun_path`'s 104 bytes — a platform limit a single-platform suite cannot see); #451 an ~8000-token ceiling on EVERY distributed prompt; #454-#460 from one tester's two-node pool. `round_log_0904_*.md`.
- **.147-.152** (09-02/03): the processor route (#444); #438 resend ladder; #440 prefix-cache snapshots never charged (5 → 23 tok/s); three failover defects from ONE trace (#434/#435/#436). `round_log_0902_*.md`, `round_log_0903_processor_route.md`.
- **.142-.146** (09-01): hybrid GPU/CPU layer splitting (#431, 5.0 → 12.25 tok/s); **no Mac had EVER been able to update itself (#430)**; **every node was lying about how fast it is (#428/#429)**; **the "safe to share" button shared everyone's IP address (#426)**. `round_log_0901_diagnostics_privacy.md`.
- **.136-.141** (08-30/31): faults visible ONLY over the network or ONLY on a released binary — #416 multi-byte replies refused as lost, #414 replies arriving twice, #418 244 s vs 0.80 s, #420 naive BPE (141 s), #421 every newline sent as `<unk>`. ⚠ **The perf bug was the LEAD, not the bug**, and a tokenizer compared only against its own past cannot be shown correct. `round_log_0831_tokenizer_quadratic.md` (LAST section first).
- **.132-.135** (08-29/30): **the guards were the defect** — five tested by PLANTING the violation, four could not see what they guard (#413); #410 GGUF headers off an UNBUFFERED file (11.2 s → 0.21 s). ⚠ Split utime/stime BEFORE theorising. `round_log_0830_guard_audit.md`.
- **.120-.131** (08-25→28): a corrupt shard PROVED to spread — **only the ORIGIN settles it** (#382); .121 then quarantined the GOOD copy (#384) — **a repair mechanism is a destruction mechanism**. `round_log_0825_overnight_watch.md`.
- **.101-.119** (08-18→24): CPU prefill +20-40% / decode +25-37%; 25.7x from a budget read off the BOOT SNAPSHOT (#281, third time). ⚠ **#367 min-of-N is for benchmarks, NOT live measurement.**
- **.15-.100** (07-23→08-17): the era that produced most of the rules — credits switched OFF, the whole prompt pipeline wrong (#246-#253), AVX2 compiled OUT of releases (3.09x), settings that saved and did nothing (#281 → `SharedState::cfg()`).
- **R136-R150 + the 20 build phases**: NAT/reachability, SWARM-SPEC cascade, `swarmpool://` v2, cross-pool routing. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § phase history.

## Public-Facing Repo (2026-07-22)

The repo is public and a **GitHub webhook relays activity to the project Discord** —
every commit and push is broadcast to real users, including non-technical ones
deciding whether to run this software. Commit subjects must stand alone in a feed
with no context; lead with user-visible impact before mechanism; never name a person
or paste private correspondence; get sign-off before force-pushes or history rewrites
(they surface in the feed and look like something broke). Full guidance in
`.claude/rules/workflow.md` § "Pushes are public-facing".

## Common Commands

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features dev,claude-subscription  # Dev build (live frontend + Claude Code)
cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Lint (MUST pass before push)
cargo test                           # All tests
cargo run -- run -p 8800 -v          # Start daemon
```

**Note:** Always include `claude-subscription` feature when testing Claude Code integration. Bare `--features dev` omits the Claude subscription provider.
